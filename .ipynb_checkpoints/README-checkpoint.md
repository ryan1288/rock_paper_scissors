# Rock Paper Scissors with Jetbot

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Collect data to form a database of training, validation, and test images
* Apply transfer learning using the AlexNet to output 3 Softmax classifiers
* Use machine learning techniques to determine when the training is sufficient
* Intelligently generate rock/paper/scissor outputs from the Jetbot
* Use physical motion to indicate when to perform hand gesture
* Collect statistics on winrate
* Gradually improve to defeat the player overtime
